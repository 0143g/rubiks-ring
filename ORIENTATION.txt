my default state for the cube is:
green front, white top, orange left, red right, yellow bottom, blue back.

when i say i am tilting the cube forward, i mean i am rotating the physical cube, moving the white top towards the back. i am rotating the cube AWAY from me. imagine throwing a knife forward, the direction in which the knife is spinning is how i am rotating it.

when i say i am tilting the cube backward, i mean i am rotating the physical cube, moving the white top towards the front. i am rotating the cube TOWARDS me. imagine throwing a basketball. the direction in which the basketball is spinning is how i am rotating it, towards me.

when i say i am tilting the cube to the right, imagine looking at the front of the cube straight on. it's green. the cube will be rotating clockwise. that is the direction in which i am tilting the cube. 

the same logic applies but for left. the cube will be rotating counterclockwise. that is the direction i am tilting the cube when i say i am tilting it to the left.

the remaining axis is what i refer to as "spin" so to speak. its spinning the cube like food in a microwave would spin, or like how a ballerina would spin.
