ðŸ“Š Next steps:
1. If you see memory leaks, check for unclosed resources
2. If you see queue buildup, the event loop may be blocked
3. If you see performance degradation, check for accumulating data structures
4. High latency in socketio_emit could indicate browser/network issues
5. High latency in bridge_send could indicate controller bridge issues
