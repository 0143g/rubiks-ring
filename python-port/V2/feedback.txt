this is much better architecturally - you've eliminated the thread explosion problem. but there's still an issue that's causing your lag:

**the gamepad.update() calls are excessive**

you're calling `gamepad.update()` after every single state change. for combos, you're calling it 5+ times in rapid succession. each update() call sends a report to the windows driver, which has overhead.

fix this by batching updates:

```python
# in handle_orientation - you're already doing this right
self.gamepad.left_joystick_float(x_value_float=joy_x, y_value_float=joy_y)
self.gamepad.right_joystick_float(x_value_float=joy_z, y_value_float=0)
self.gamepad.update()  # single update for all changes

# but in execute_combo you're doing:
self.gamepad.press_button(b1)
self.gamepad.update()  # update 1
await asyncio.sleep(0.05)
self.gamepad.press_button(b2)
self.gamepad.update()  # update 2
await asyncio.sleep(0.1)
self.gamepad.release_button(b2)
self.gamepad.release_button(b1)
self.gamepad.update()  # update 3
```

change combos to:
```python
self.gamepad.press_button(b1)
# no update here
await asyncio.sleep(0.05)
self.gamepad.press_button(b2)
self.gamepad.update()  # single update after both pressed
await asyncio.sleep(0.1)
self.gamepad.release_button(b2)
self.gamepad.release_button(b1)
self.gamepad.update()  # single update after both released
```

**other issues i see:**

1. **sprint logic in orientation handler** - this is getting called 125 times per second. move sprint state changes to a separate task that runs at 10hz to avoid rapid on/off

2. **no periodic update task** - if orientation stops coming but joysticks are held, they'll stick. add a safety task:
```python
async def update_loop(self):
    while True:
        await asyncio.sleep(0.016)  # 60hz
        self.gamepad.update()
```

3. **missing stats** - you have no visibility into actual rates. add basic counters to see if you're actually getting 20hz from the cube or if it's dropping

this version is definitely cleaner than the threaded mess, but test if the lag is from:
- bluetooth connection issues (cube not sending data consistently)
- windows gamepad driver overhead (try reducing update() calls)
- the cube itself (battery low? firmware issues?)

if inputs still aren't registering, add debug prints in handle_move to see if events are even arriving.
