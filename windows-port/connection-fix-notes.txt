GAN Cube Windows Bluetooth Connection Fix
==========================================

ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
The connection was failing because our code incorrectly interpreted noble's success callback.

In the @stoprocent/noble library:
- peripheral.connect(callback) calls callback(error) 
- When error is undefined/null = CONNECTION SUCCESS
- When error is an object = CONNECTION FAILURE

PROBLEM:
Our code was treating 'undefined' as an error:
  if (error) { reject(...) }  // This treated undefined as truthy!

FIX APPLIED:
Changed the condition to explicitly check:
  if (error !== null && error !== undefined) { reject(...) }

This should resolve the "Failed to connect: undefined" error.

TEST STEPS:
1. Copy this windows-port folder to Windows machine
2. Run start-native-service.bat  
3. Open http://localhost:3000
4. Click "Connect Cube"
5. Connection should now succeed instead of failing with "undefined"

If you still get connection issues after this fix, it may be:
- Windows Bluetooth service problems
- Cube not in pairing mode
- Driver/permission issues
- Need to run as Administrator
