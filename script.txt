throughout the thousands of years of documented history, every now and then someone comes around who literally changes the world. geniuses with novel ideas that alter the course of humanity: people like issac newton, albert einstein, jesus.

i am not one of those people, but i do have a lot of ideas. most of them... aren't great. but sometimes you gotta get through the bad ideas to get to the good ones. and yeah, this is definitely one of the bad ones.

[iron pineapple-esque intro (overloaded, pacifist, etc)]

can you beat elden ring with a rubiks cube? now look i know the first thing you're probably thinking is why? why do that? because it'd be FUNNY and people on the internet would like it. and the second thing you're probably thinking is: how is that even possible? it's a plastic cube that does nothing but cause stress and confusion. and yeah maybe for YOU but for me i'm actually pretty alright at it, nothing crazy though.

the main hurdle is answering the question: how do i take a piece of plastic and turn it into a functioning gaming controller? and i think i know just how to do that.

[cube intro and tech shit]

so one night recently i was completely and entirely sober and, as sober people tend to do, they stumble onto chinese rubiks cube websites. i happened to come across a website and found this: the gan356 i 3 smart cube. it's just like a regular cube except it has bluetooth capabilities. now apparently you're supposed to use it by connecting the cube to their app and it'll show you stats for your solves and stuff but fuck all that i wanna break it. see according to the product description, you get "ultra-precise tracking, gyroscope-based motion capture, and up to 15 hours of playtime." nobody has ever lied about the capabilities of their product just to get sales before, so i am sure this will work great.

so i got the cube and took it out of the box and shit and figured i should test out how functional it really is. i tried to connect the cube to their official app but then i realized it's all in chinese which i probably should have expected. so i skipped all that and decided to just go and figure it out myself. i might not be able to read chinese but i can read data. all i have to do is setup a script to check what the cube is sending over bluetooth and... ah yes it's all fucking encrypted who would've guessed. turns out companies don't want you messing with and breaking their products, but i'm gonna do it anyway.

now i have the fun task of figuring out what all of this shit means. ladies and gentlemen i've figured out what all of this shit means. 

now instead of a jumbled mess we have actual words and numbers that i can read. the cube is pretty much constantly spitting out information about it's state in a bunch of different ways. like if i turn one of the cube faces, it knows that and sends me that updated info. but more importantly, they weren't lying about that gyroscope-based motion capture. after slamming my head against a wall for a few hours trying to figure out what the fuck a quaternion is, i managed to actually stream the coordinate data that represents the rotation of the cube in real life which made me feel happy for a couple seconds. now they advertised it as "ultra-precise tracking" so i wanted to see how precise that really is.

when you use a mouse or a ps5 controller to play a game or buy a new monitor you probably care about how many hz it is, how many times per second you're getting updates. gaming mice these days range anywhere from 1000 to 8000 hz. a ps5 controller or a new gaming monitor usually range between 240 to 500 hz. the cube gets about... 14. 14 hz. and that's on a good day. there were some days where i tested this and it would end up under 10. to show you visually just how bad it is, this is footage which will represent the ps5 controller at 240hz scaled down to 60fps for youtube. and this footage represents the cube at 14hz scaled down proportionally to... 4fps. so yeah... they lied. i spent $60 on this.

anyway, it's just gonna have to work. what's important now is that when we do something with the cube, it gets reported here. fantastic. now we just need to figure out how to map controls from a ps5 controller to the cube, and this part is a lot easier. the cube has 6 faces and each face can be turned clockwise or counterclockwise so we have 12 different slots to bind later on which is more than enough. the part that wasn't as easy was the realization that, oh shit, a controller has two sticks for movement: one for the character itself and one for the camera. i only have one stick... and it's not even a stick. here's the solution i came up with: we have 3 axies to move on so we have pitch, yaw, and roll. pitch is just tilting the cube forward or backward, so this made sense to move forward and backward. i made roll be responsible for moving left or right. then yaw was responsible for turning the camera left or right.
