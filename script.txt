throughout the thousands of years of documented history, every now and then someone comes around who literally changes the world. geniuses with novel ideas that alter the course of humanity: people like issac newton, albert einstein, jesus.

i am not one of those people, but i do have a lot of ideas. most of them... aren't great. but sometimes you gotta get through the bad ideas to get to the good ones. and yeah, this is definitely one of the bad ones.

[iron pineapple-esque intro (overloaded, pacifist, etc)]

can you beat elden ring with a rubiks cube? now look i know the first thing you're probably thinking is why? why do that? because it'd be FUNNY and people on the internet would like it. and the second thing you're probably thinking is: how is that even possible? it's a plastic cube that does nothing but cause stress and confusion. and yeah maybe for YOU but for me i'm actually pretty alright at it, nothing crazy though.

the main hurdle is answering the question: how do i take a piece of plastic and turn it into a functioning gaming controller? and i think i know just how to do that.

[cube intro and tech shit]

so one night recently i was completely and entirely sober and, as sober people tend to do, they stumble onto chinese rubiks cube websites. i happened to come across a website and found this: the gan356 i 3 smart cube. it's just like a regular cube except it has bluetooth capabilities. now apparently you're supposed to use it by connecting the cube to their app and it'll show you stats for your solves and stuff but fuck all that i wanna break it. see according to the product description, you get "ultra-precise tracking, gyroscope-based motion capture, and up to 15 hours of playtime." fortunately nobody has ever lied about the capabilities of their product just to get sales before, so i am sure this will work great.

so i got the cube and took it out of the box and shit and figured i should test out how functional it really is. i tried to connect the cube to their official app but then i realized it's all in chinese which i probably should have expected. so i skipped all that and decided to just go and figure it out myself. i might not be able to read chinese but i can read data. all i have to do is setup a script to check what the cube is sending over bluetooth and... ah yes it's all fucking encrypted who would've guessed. turns out companies don't want you messing with and breaking their products, but i'm gonna do it anyway.

now i have the fun task of figuring out what all of this shit means. ladies and gentlemen i've figured out what all of this shit means. 

now instead of a jumbled mess we have actual words and numbers that i can read. the cube is pretty much constantly spitting out information about it's state in a bunch of different ways. like if i turn one of the cube faces, it knows that and sends me that updated info. but more importantly, they weren't lying about that gyroscope-based motion capture. after slamming my head against a wall for a few hours trying to figure out what the fuck a quaternion is, i managed to actually stream the coordinate data that represents the rotation of the cube in real life which made me feel happy for a couple seconds. now they advertised it as "ultra-precise tracking" so i wanted to see how precise that really is.

when you use a mouse or a ps5 controller to play a game or buy a new monitor you probably care about how many hz it is, how many times per second you're getting updates. gaming mice these days range anywhere from 1000 to 8000 hz. a ps5 controller or a new gaming monitor usually range between 240 to 500 hz. the cube gets about... 14. 14 hz. and that's on a good day. there were some days where i tested this and it would end up under 10. to show you visually just how bad it is, this is footage which will represent the ps5 controller at 240hz scaled down to 60fps for youtube. and this footage represents the cube at 14hz scaled down proportionally to... 4fps. so yeah... they lied. i spent $60 on this shit.

[controls]

anyway, it's just gonna have to work. what's important now is that when we do something with the cube, it gets reported here. fantastic. now we just need to figure out how to map controls from a ps5 controller to the cube, and this part is a lot easier. the cube has 6 faces and each face can be turned clockwise or counterclockwise so we have 12 different slots to bind later on which is more than enough. the part that wasn't as easy was the realization that, oh shit, a controller has two sticks for movement: one for the character itself and one for the camera. i only have one stick... and it's not even a stick. 

here's the solution i came up with: we have 3 axies to move on so we have pitch, yaw, and roll. pitch is just tilting the cube forward or backward, so this made sense to simulate the left stick moving forward and backward. i made roll be responsible for moving the left stick left or right. then lastly yaw was responsible for turning the camera on the right stick left or right. which means i'm just missing one thing, moving the camera up and down... yeah, i just simply will not have that ability... i just ran out of rotations what do you want from me. but for what it's worth, after spending like 8 hours trying to get the orientations right to get the actual desired result, it doesn't feel too bad. i even managed to make it so that if i tilted the cube far enough forward, i would automatically sprint. this definitely isn't going to cause me a ton of problems later on, but let's just pretend i didn't say that.

it was at this point that it felt reasonably possible that i could actually play with this thing. i spent an hour or so figuring out the optimal binds to play with, and i eventually settled on this:

i had to think about which faces felt the easiest and most natural to use and for me that was the top and bottom face. i could flick these with my index and ring fingers in both directions, so i felt that these should be for the most crucial 4 buttons. 

on the top side, i decided to bind roll and light attack. because i'd have to often string these together, i didn't want to put them somewhere where i'd need to break my wrist hundreds of times a day to execute. 

on the bottom side, i put jump and heavy attack. jump r2 attacks do a ton of damage and require just a handful of brain cells to pull off which is perfect for someone like me.

on the left side, i put square and triangle. square to use items and heal and triangle to pick up and interact with stuff. 

on the right side, i put l2 to use ashes of war. there are a ton of them, and if i'm going to actually stand any chance of getting through this, i'm gonna need to be able to use them. i also made a bind specifically to call in torrent. now i usually put torrent in my extra pouch at the bottom, but this would require me to hold down triangle and then press down on the dpad. how the fuck am i supposed to hold down a turn on the cube? so i went in and explicitly put in some logic for whenever i make this specific face turn, to execute those two button presses together.

on the back side, i saved these slots for buttons i would need to press, but maybe not so often, so i opted for r3 to lock onto enemies because there is absolutely zero fucking way i can play this without locking on, and also a bind to two hand my weapon.

then lastly the front face is used entirely for swapping through weapons and items, so right on the dpad and down on the dpad.

and that's it. i finally had a somewhat kind of functioning cube controller. i really wasn't even sure that this was going to be possible at the start so getting this far had me optimistic... and now, the only thing left to do was actually beat the game.

[game footage starts]

[farming]

in order to make my life as hard as possible, i decided to start with the wretch class at level 1. i decided to make my character red because i am going to be angry this entire time. i also gave him the frieren haircut because i thought it would be cute.

so i spawned in, ran out and immediately noticed i was blocking for some reason. this was particularly confusing because i never actually binded the left bumper to anything which is how you block, so there's that. i managed to actually hit the tutorial boss a single time which was more than i thought i would get. but i arrived in limgrave, ran over to the gatefront site of grace, talked to melina, and got torrent. 

the problem is now i had to actually figure out what to do. i didn't realistically think i would get this far, so i never actually planned out a route or how to go about this, so i'm just gonna wing the entire thing. the first thing would be to get some levels on me, so you already know where i'm going. because i started with the wretch, i only have a club on me, so i needed to grab a bleed weapon. i went to fight the bloody finger summon in the river near gatefront. i imagined this fight would be pretty easy because you actually automatically get the friendly summon Yura to help fight him. and then i remembered i'm level 1.

yeah, he basically one shots me as you'd expect. but eventually i was able to kite long enough, get a couple hits in, and let Yura finish him off to get the reduvia dagger. this is a good time to mention one of the biggest problems i'll experience this entire run. it goes without saying that the creators of this piece of plastic never expected anyone to use it in this way for such a long time. without warning the cube will sometimes freeze up for multiple seconds at a time or just disconnect entirely. i could be running on torrent somewhere or in the middle of a fight or being one hit away from beating a boss and all of a sudden i can't do anything. i'm just stuck on whatever the last movement was until i tab out and reconnect the cube. i never could figure out if it was overheating or if i was connecting it the wrong way or if the fbi was sitting outside my house aiming a jammer at my window. the only way i can explain it is like you're playing a game on like 70 ping and then every now and then without any warning or reason, your ping spikes to like 4000 for a couple seconds with no guarantee it'll go back to normal.

but all despite that, i made it to the third church of marika, got the physick flask, and took the portal to the top of caelid. i made my way outside, went across the bridge, and got the site of grace by first farm i could think of. if you didn't know, running down this hill spawns in this ball behind you, and if you run to the right and make the ball fall off the cliff, you actually get a couple thousand runes for it. let's just say i'm gonna be using this... a lot. this is perfect for me because at level 1, i don't really wanna fight anything... at all. so i sat here for a few minutes, died a couple times, and eventually leveled up to level 11 so i can equip the reduvia dagger. i made my way all the way down the hill over to fort faroth, went inside, grabbed the right half of the dectus medallion for later, and managed to somehow make the jump across to grab radagon's soreseal on my first attempt.

this is perfect for early game because i get 5 levels into vigor, endurance, strength, and dexterity while only increasing my damage taken by 15%. then, of course, i ran outside to greyoll and proceeded to spam r1 with reduvia for the next 5 minutes until he died. i've never killed this boss "legit" and i don't think i ever will. using the 75000 runes i got from killing him, i went and leveled up all the way to level 32.

since i was in caelid, i figured i would go and grab my most beloved weapon: the greatsword. normally you need 31 strength to properly hold this, but because of radagon's soreseal and the 50% scaling buff you get from two-handing a weapon, i could use it already. i went to the cathedral of dragon communion next. there's a single banished knight standing outside, and every time you kill him he has a chance of dropping any piece of the banished knight set. it's one of the better armor sets in the game and i figured i should try and get it now. i sat here killing him for probably 15-20 minutes, lost all my runes a couple times, and, finally, i got a drop. it's the sword... that i don't want. so i went back at it, killed him some more, and got another drop. it's the shield... that i also don't want. after literally 45 minutes i managed to get the entire armor set which i can't even wear because i'd be overloaded, so helmet and gauntlets are gonna have to do for now.

[tree sentinel]

by now i was getting somewhat comfortable with the controls, it felt more and more natural running around and looting and killing enemies, so i decided it was time for a challenge. it's time to fight the tree sentinel. the boss that filters out every new player who doesn't realize they can just run right past the fucking guy. it knew this was going to be a stressful fight. i had no idea how much damage i'd do even though i'd leveled up quite a bit. it wasn't off to a good start, the cube took over and decided to start lagging heavily. my inputs were coming out seconds later than they should've and i knew this was going to be a wipe. but then, divine intervention. somehow he missed me. i don't even know myself what happened from here on out. it was like something took over me. my jump r2 monkey brain kicked in and i was actually doing pretty good damage. even better, i wasn't getting one shot. i burned through all my heals and it came down to the wire, but somehow, someway, i managed to kill it on my first attempt.

[margit]

with this confidence i booked it straight to the first main boss: margit. and my first run was actually going pretty good as well, but around half hp he breaks out a couple new moves with his golden daggers and hammer and i got caught. and then the next attempt i got caught again by the same exact move because i do not learn from my mistakes. but my third attempt went a bit better, actually a lot better. i was trading back and forth with him, getting a lot of hits in, and eventually he staggered. the lower and lower his health got, the more and more i could feel the the cube acting up. my inputs would lag more and more. at some point, i just decided to stay as close as possible to him in hopes that he would just swing over me and miss and that my delayed attacks would eventually one day execute and hopefully hit him. and i kept this up as long as i could until... 

yeah, i managed to get him on my third try. i honestly wasn't really expecting this. every fight that i win feels so much better than you could imagine and getting through the first major boss was a big mental hurdle. 

[stormveil]

next was time for stormveil castle. first order of business was removing gostoc from the face of this earth for all the times he's robbed me without my knowledge. then i lost a 1v1 to a bird. i ran through the left side of the castle, grabbed the rusty key, killed the knight, then ran off the edge and died. this is where the cube lag gets super painful. if i'm up on a high ledge or need to have even the slightest bit of accurate movement, i am entirely at the mercy of the flimsy bluetooth connection between the cube and my pc.

much like in real life, birds are my worst enemy in this game. because i lock onto every enemy and birds fly, i usually will automatically be looking upward after killing any bird. but if you remember, i don't have control over looking up and down with my camera. so i'm stuck looking into the sky. however, i have to break out the ancient esoteric knowledge for a hidden technique. i learned that if you just spin your camera directly left or directly right for long enough, you'll eventually reset your camera to be level again. this is a very important method and i'm going to be using it a lot in this run.

another important method is what i'm calling the shimmy. again, because i can't look down and because of the random lag, getting accurate positioning can be pretty hard sometimes. however, with the shimmy method, if i just sit the cube down on my desk and very gently tilt it in the direction i'm trying to go, i'll slowly inch myself into position.

[godrick]

after wandering through stormveil castle for awhile, it was time to make the final sprint to the site of grace before godrick. fighting all the enemies here isn't really any option. i can barely handle one enemy, 30 is not happening. i tried running through, got to the last staircase, and then the cube disconnects. and then it happened again. and then it happened again. but eventually i made it. i wanted to go in and give it a little heat check since i kinda ran through the last two bosses.

yeah godrick wasn't exactly having it. godrick isn't typically a big challenge in runs, but with the input lag and his AOE moves that kept catching me off guard, i figured i needed a bit more. i knew the claw talisman was in stormveil castle and with how much i'm spamming the jump r2, i figured i should go get it. but, of course, i have to do even more platforming. but we're in luck, the shimmy method. it's slow but it works. i got to the last section, almost died at the very end, but pulled through and grabbed the talisman.

honestly it didn't do that much. it helped of course, but i just kept losing it at some point from some AOE attack that i just couldn't space or some projectile that literally came out of fucking nowhere. also, you know what else barely works? the crits. i could be standing right infront of the bosses head, hit r1, and i just end up swinging the sword like a fucking idiot. i died again, and again, and again, and eventually, i got this run.

[liurnia / caelid sidequest]

with my first shardbearer down, i had made it to liurnia. i grabbed another sacred tear. then made my way all the way to the raya lucaria crystal tunnel so i could get the smithing stone miners bell bearing 1 that drops after defeating the crystalian at the end. up until this point i was using an un-upgraded weapon and it felt like time to start. i went back to the roundtable, leveled it up to level 6, then went on my next sidequest back to caelid. inside fort gael are two things that will be very important to our run. first is flame grant me strength which is one of the most basic but most valuable incantations in the game. it boosts your physical and fire damage by 20% as well as your stamina recovery by 10%. 

second is lions claw, an ash of war that is perfect for the greatsword. it does a ton of damage and gives you hyperarmor so that you can use it without getting knocked out of attacks. the problem is that i have to get inside the fort to get this, and even though they could just open the fucking gate, i have to yet again do some parkour. i have to jump around this sketchy tree branch, not die to this spear guy, then once i get to the top of the ladder i have to walk on this tight beam without falling and without aggroing this guy which clearly doesn't always go well. and then, and only then, do i get a chance to get the ash of war, by killing this elder lion. 

this took me 45 real life minutes.

[raya lucaria / rellana]

but anyway i went back to the roundtable and equipped it with the heavy attunement and had a build i was pretty comfortable with for the moment. i ran up the left side of liurnia, found the homie iji, grabbed a golden seed, grabbed the academy key, and made my way into raya lucaria. now every time i've ever gone here, i run past the burger king guys, open the door, and die to these spinny cage guys but i think this is the first time i've ever made it through, got the grace and didn't immediately die. i pretty much booked it all the way through the castle until i got to the red wolf of radagon. i hate this fucking thing. it jumps around so much. it spams magic. it has such little health and the fact that i only needed to hit him like 5 or 6 times but still died to it so much drove me insane. then to top it all off the cube would work it's own magic by just breaking multiple times back to back. so yeah, this had me really annoyed. but nothing could prepare me for what was next. not moongrum, he got nuked.

renalla, oh renalla. oh how i despised this woman. the first phase of this fight is generally one of the easiest things in the entire game. just hit all the crawlers that are golden ring on them, don't get hit by the flying books, and it's over before you know it. but guess what? not for me. if i was going insane from rage before, this one just short circuited my brain. i can barely control the camera with this thing, so i was using the lock on system to sort of take that out of the equation. the problem is that when there's 30 idiots crawling around on the floor and you only want one of them, your task basically becomes fucking impossible. i'd try and lock onto something directly infront of me, then i'd lock onto something across the room. this basically forced me to do this first phase with no camera lock. but that's fine it's not that bad. well, eventually i knocked her on the floor, i couldn't even use lions claw properly because for some reason i would just fling off to the side. usually you phase her within one or two knockdowns, but because of how challenging it was to just make contact with her sometimes, it would often take me 3 or 4 knockdowns to make it work. then on other runs i couldn't even manage to hit the crawlers on the ground who literally aren't fucking moving i just couldn't do it. oh and then the stupid ass song they sing like i started disassociating from hearing it because i kept hearing them say "anvil" and then i started thining about how renalla is not a blacksmith and was very confused. 

just the first phase of every attempt took me 4 to 5 minutes. then i would finally, finally make it to the second phase and then she would spam me with like 3 spells at once or summon a giant troll to drone strike me from outer space and i'd get to do it all over again. then as always the cube would have it's own incident and i'd have to restart it but sometimes even restarting it doesn't fix the problem so i'd literally have to sit here and solve the cube to get it's gyroscope internally aligned or something at least that's what i told myself because once i did that it would start to actually perform a little better for awhile. so i'm sitting here furious after dying to this easy ass boss being forced to solve a rubiks cube to give myself a better chance at the run.

but with enough perserverence and brain damage, you can do anything. i got through the first phase, got a nice stagger near the start of the second phase, then got lucky with her choice of summon for this attempt and she managed to, finally, go down.

i really needed a change of scenery after that so i decided to immediately leave. since i had taken down two shardbearers, i could make my way to altus plateau. i just needed to stop at fort haight to grab the other half of the dectus medallion. i got to altus, got some golden seeds along the way, got the second smithing stone bell bearing, and upgraded my greatsword to +12. i figured i'd give the cube a break and decided to call it a day here. i got on the next day and decided to fight the godskin apostle in the windmill village. i'm not really sure what compelled me to do this, but i did... i died to it 26 times. i really don't know what happened i don't wanna talk about it.

[radahn]

now i know that with godrick and renalla down, there's no real reason for me to have to fight radahn, but i decided to do it anyway. radahn is a cool fight and i figured it would be a shame to not fight him on this run. i had made it to altus already, so that automatically activated the radahn festival, so i could just run straight to the boss. so i did just that... and i died without even touching him. as is the common theme with this run, this fight sucks dick. there are of course many different summons around the arena to spawn in. you just have to run over the sign, hit triangle, and they'll spawn in. well, there's a couple problems with that. first off is getting torrent to actually run where i want him to, he has a lot of trouble cooperating. second, because i am running pretty quickly and there's input lag from when i input the triangle move  with the cube to when it actually hits the game, i have to predict ahead of time when to press it to actually get the summon to spawn in. slowing down isn't really an option because he'll hit me for 90% of my health.

so, we have to introduce yet another hidden method: the pinwheel. the pinwheel is a very elegant technique. because getting the actual timing down of when to press it is much harder than it seems due to input delay that's out of my control, this method says fuck timing anything just spam and hope for the best. so as i run over the summons, i spin the left side of the cube and just pray. that's the entire strat. it actually works pretty well. the problem comes when i actually have to fight him. he's big and he runs around... a lot. his swings hit a much larger area than it really seems like, and i got hit by a lot of collateral damage from him swinging at the summons. and because i don't have individual control over where i'm running and the camera at the same time, positioning was really hard. i died a lot. so much that i actually felt the need to visit my trusty ball a few more times to level vigor and endurance a bit more. i came back, managed to summon everyone in, and even managed to resummon a few after he entered his second phase. eventually he went down. is this the most interesting way to beat him? no, but honestly i do not care. i didn't technically need to even fight him, and the summons are in the arena and clearly part of the fight, but whatever, he's dead.

[journey to/through volcano]

after fighting radahn i needed a bit of a break, so i went to just go pick up a few more sacred tears around some churches that i forgot as well as paying a visit to some dogs that are guarding the turtle talisman which should help my stamina recovery a bit. just need to put in the stonesword key... and fuck me i don't have one. just put in the stonesword key and grab it out of the chest.

then i remembered that since i made it to altus, i have easy access to mount gelmir and volcano manor. i made the run over, spent like 10 minutes climbing ladders, tried fighting the fallingstar beast a grand total of 1 time before deciding i cannot be bothered, and eventually made it to the manor. i made it behind the manor, ran through the entire area as fast as i could, got sucked off in a dark room by an enemy that i honestly do not remember existing, and then opened the bridge shortcut that gets a sick ass cutscene for some reason. and now it's time to fight the lone godskin noble. and you can probably already guess how this is going to go. 

[godskin noble]

it's yet another boss that shouldn't really be that hard that for some reason is just the worst experience of my life. like yes, everyone knows his roll move is annoying, that's nothing new. yes, he can stab you through the pillars that are here for some reason, that's nothing new as well. but holy shit if this wasn't one of the worst moments in the run. he would walk behind the pillars, and if he's out of my site for too long, my camera unlocks, and trust me in this stupid ass room it's almost an impossible task to relock on. trying to get him stuck on a pole while rolling would work sometimes, and then he'd decide fuck that and just slip right past it. i'd stagger him, then the cube would decide to just stop responding while trying to hit the crit. i'd get him to 1 hit, then die. i'd run in for a jump r2, then bounce off his stomach onto an object i didn't even know i could stand on, then die behind a pole to his fat ass gut. i'd get him to 1 hit and have him staggered, walk up to hit the crit, then just do a normal attack and die. my blood pressure probably doubled fighting him, so the relief i felt when i got this run was unmatched.

[deaths poker + rewrite]

i actually had to go to bed after fighting him because if i played anymore i might have ended up in the hospital. the next day i had a change of heart, i realized i was using the greatsword for quite some time and while yes, i could beat the game with it, probably, i wanna try something else. in caelid, this death rite bird that only spawns at night drops the deaths poker, a greatsword with a really nice ash of war on it that could melt bosses. the problem is that... well, i have to kill the death rite bird. i hate these things on a normal playthrough and i hate them just as much in nightreign, so using the cube to beat it wasn't going to be much more enjoyable. i tried a few times normally but his head is so annoying to hit and with how much he moves it i can barely get any attacks in. i decided to try and use holy water pots against it since holy damage is super strong against undead enemies, and yeah, they did a ton. i just had to use them to get him low and then go in to get the last few hits in... and die. and then i'd run out of pots so i'd need to go make more and yeah... this took longer than it should've. on the run where i beat him, he kind of just stood there as i took massive chunks off his health bar. but regardless, i got the deaths poker. this is a somber weapon, so heading back to the homie iji and let me get the deaths poker up to +4 right away. it causes frost build up, and the ash of war on it when combined with a light attack causes this line of ghostflame that sort of just sits there for a few seconds and hits multiple times for massive damage.

so great, it's a new day, we have a new weapon, you know what else we need? that's right. a brand new complete rewrite of the code that i've been using for the entire video so far. the behavior of the cube really started to frustrate me. the random freezes started to become more and more frequent. inputs seemed to drop more and more often. i couldn't use the cube for more than like 30 miunutes without needing to let the cube rest for a bit. i took my original code from a couple thousand lines of code down to just a few hundred. i removed a lot of the "enhancements" and "protective" things i put in place and stripped it down to the bare necessities. basically, anything that might introduce some lag or extra processing, i removed. and this is what happened.

so yeah, at this point, i don't know if i fixed it. i don't know if it's better or if it's worse. but regardless, i do know that it works just as well with a lot less bloat, and that's pretty good. i also added support for multiple sets of keybinds. for example, if i'm in the world and i want to call in torrent, i can do that easily, but if i'm in a boss fight, that input slot is basically going unused. but now, i can swap between multiple sets of keybinds with the press of a button, and swap torrents input to something else... like an incantation.

[dts]

to test out my brand new custom made technology, i went to fight the draconic tree sentinel guarding the capital entrance. now i could fight him normally... or... i could go to the weeping peninsula, spend a few minutes trying to kill this beetle before realizing i, infact, cannot kill it without a ranged weapon, leave to buy a crossbow, come back and kill it to get the poison mist incantation, buy a finger seal, then run all the way back to the draconic tree sentinel to sneak up behind him and use poison mist, then wait 15 real life minutes and kill him that way. and that's what i did. now to be honest with you, i fully intended to kill him normally, but i was also pretty hungry and this seemed like a good opportunity to make progress and eat at the same time so yeah.

[capital/goldfrey]

but finally, we made it to leyndell. and seeing the capital made me realize how far into the game i actually was. i ran all the way through the buildings, down to the street below just a few steps away from the site of grace, got dumpstered by the erdtree avatar. i came back, got the grace, climbed up the dragon wing, past the gargoyle, up the tree, and made it to piss godfrey... and died without landing a single hit. but honestly he wasn't too bad, i like godfreys moveset and i've had a lot of practice with him over the years because he used to absolutely shit on me. he's still an input reading piece of shit though like look at this he dashes at me on the first frame of me drinking my flask. but yeah i managed to get him on my fourth try. and then like 5 seconds after i sat at the site of grace the cube had one of it's moments and got really excited and wanted to run around in circles so i guess i didn't fix shit.

[volcano manor quests / rykard]

before i move on in the capital, i remembered i had some unfinished business in volcano manor. i grabbed a somber 6 i forgot to pick up along the way, upgraded the deaths poker again, then spoke to bernahl to do some of the volcano manor quests. i invaded some poor guy, killed him, then got another quest to go and help bernahl kill two NPCs in leyndell. we did that and i was rewarded with the raging wolf armor set which to be honest is worse than the banished knight armor set in most ways but it looks cool as fuck and now i can wear a chest piece without being heavy load so that's pretty cool.

back at volcano manor i decided it was time to fight rykard. i didn't think this was going to be too awful going in. in a way it's a gimmick fight and you get to use the serpent hunter in the arena, and yeah, my first attempt i did decent damage so i wasn't too worried. i realized i could just run into the lava beneath him and tank it because it really didn't do too much damage at all and he actually can barely hit you here. just broke out the ol' trusty jump r2 and chunked the everliving shit out of him. didn't really have any issues and it only took me like 4 tries.
